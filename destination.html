                            <p>
                                Ta Tai waterfall is a semi-natural site located in Ta Tai village, Ta Tai
                                commune, Smach Meanchey district, about 20 kilometers east of Koh Kong 
                                provincial town along National Road 48. There are 84 families living in 
                                this area. They earn their living by fishing and hunting.
                                <br>
                                The waterfall has two stages. The first stage is 5 to 6 meters high; the 
                                second stage is 12 to 15 meters high. Ta Tai waterfall was developed as a 
                                model site in Koh Kong to attract local and foreign tourists.Ta Tai waterfall 
                                is also known as Ta Eysei waterfall. According to legend, a man named Ta Tai 
                                and his son went to the waterfall to fish because the waterfall was the joining 
                                point between fresh water and salt water. There was a storm and the resulting
                                floods carried away Ta Tai's son.
                                <br>
                                Four or five days later, however, the boy was found at the same spot from where
                                he disappeared. When Ta Tai questioned his son, the boy said: "There is someone
                                who took me to a secret place, where he turned into a vampire and wanted to kill
                                me. But suddenly Ta Eysei (a hermit) appeared to save me and took me back." After
                                hearing the story, Ta Tai and his wife believed that their son was saved by Ta Eysei 
                                or Neak Sachang (another mane of hermit). Ever since then, the Waterfall has been called
                                Ta Eysei Waterfall or Ta Tai Waterfall.

                                Khun Chhang Khun Phen stupa sits on a rock in the middle 
                                of the sea tributary, about 1 kilometer from the provincial town. The stupa is 4 meters
                                high and made of concrete. Because the site is small-only 40 square meters, including 
                                the stupa-it can accommodate only 10 to 15 visitors at a time. The stupa is about 1
                                kilometer from the provincial town. 
                                <br>
                                Koh Kong residents worship there and often visit the
                                site on national holidays and traditional festivals. Khun Chhang Khun Phen is related
                                to a Khmer legend. Once upon a time, there was villager's daughter named Thim, who was
                                loved by a man named Khun Chhang. Khun Chhang was bold-headed and not very handsome,
                                but his family was rich.Thim, however, did not love Khun Chhang, they became engaged 
                                and Khun Chhang married her.
                                <br>
                                She later betrayed her husband to love a commander named 
                                Khun Phen. When Khun Chhang learned of his wife's affair, he complained to the King.
                                The King decided to cut Thim's body into two parts. After Thim died, Khun Chhang
                                buried her at the same place where she was killed. Because he wanted her to be
                                reincarnated, Khun Chhang put up a soul flag pole on the east bank of the stream,
                                facing where Thim was buried. Then he built a stupa in memory of their love. Later,
                                the west bank of the stream was named Chetdey (a stupa) village, and the east 
                                bank was named Dangtung (a flage pole) village.

                                to legend, there once was a king who commanded an army on the island. Because there was no fresh water, 
                                the king searched everywhere to find some. At last he found a rock near the sea. Thinking the rock might 
                                contain water, the king drew his sword and split open the rock, releasing an endless flow of water that
                                local people still use today.
